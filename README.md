# About

This paper analyzed six years of monthly oyster spat settlement monitoring conducted by the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in the waters around St. Augustine, Florida, USA. Additionally, data from nearby continuous long-term water quality monitoring stations with the NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program were also incorporated to understand patterns in spat settlement as they related to environmental conditions during collector deployment.

# Abstract

As some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, the declining condition and coverage of coastal habitats consequently results in the loss of the myriad economic and ecosystem services they provide. Due to variability in physical and biological characteristics across sites, increased place-based information to inform local management projects with the goals of reestablishing economic and ecological function of coastal habitats are imperative. Since oysters are often used in many restoration projects, this study quantified spatial and temporal patterns in eastern oyster spat settlement in a bar-built estuary in northeast Florida, USA that is host to a robust population of intertidal oyster reefs. Spat settlement was found to occur from April â€“ October with small peaks in the spring and large ones around September. Inter-annual differences in spat settlement were likely influenced by existing environmental conditions and heavily affected by large-scale events such as tropical cyclones. Variations in regional spat settlements are possibly driven by the residence times of the watersheds, density of adult populations, and the location of the spat collectors. Results of this study illustrate place-based variability in oyster settlement patterns and underscore the importance of local monitoring for oyster resource management, restoration, and research.
